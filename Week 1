    - What is programming?
        At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do. 
        When you write a program, you create a step by step recipe of what needs to be done to complete 
        a task and when your computer executes the program it reads what you wrote and follows your instructions 
        to the letter.
