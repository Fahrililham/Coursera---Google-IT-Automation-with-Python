-- Data Types Recap --
In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function.

-- Implicit vs Explicit Conversion --
As we saw earlier in the video, some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion is where the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so.

By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text. Before we could do that, we needed to call the str() function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.

-- Study Guide: Expressions and Variables --
This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In the Expressions and Variables segment, you learned about expressions, variables, and the data types: string, integer, and float. You learned how to convert a value from one data type to another and you learned how to resolve a few common errors in Python.

Terms
expression - a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated

data types - classes of data (e.g., string, int, float, Boolean, etc.), which include the properties and behaviors of instances of the data type (variables)

variable - an instance of a data type class, represented by a unique name within the code, that stores changeable values of the specific data type

implicit conversion - when the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another

explicit conversion - when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:

str() - converts a value (often numeric) to a string data type

int() - converts a value (usually a float) to an integer data type

float() - converts a value (usually an integer) to a float data type
